# Modal Project

This project is a simple modal window built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A modal is a dialog box/popup window that is displayed on top of the current page. This modal project allows users to open and close a modal window by clicking a button.

## Features

- **Open and Close Modal:** Users can open the modal by clicking the "Open Modal" button, and close it by clicking outside the modal area or pressing a close button inside the modal.
- **Centered Design:** The modal appears in the center of the screen, overlaying the background for emphasis.
- **Overlay Background:** When the modal opens, the background is dimmed, drawing attention to the modal content.
- **Responsive Design:** The modal adjusts well on different screen sizes, making it functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the modal and button elements.
- **CSS**: Styles the modal window, including the overlay background and positioning.
